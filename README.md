# cookie-cats-ab-testing
Cookie Cats</a> is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by <a href="http://tactile.dk">Tactile Entertainment</a>. It's a classic "connect three"-style puzzle game where the player must connect tiles of the same color to clear the board and win the level.

Players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress.

But where should the gates be placed? Initially the first gate was placed at level 30, but in this notebook we're going to analyze an AB-test where we moved the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will look at the impact on player retention.
